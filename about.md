I'm a Senior ML & Backend Engineer currently working at EvenUp, building large-scale document generation and formatting systems.

Previously, I was at Borealis AI where I built config-driven ML pipelines processing ~30TB/day and workflow orchestration using Flyte.

My interests sit at the intersection of distributed systems, ML infrastructure, and applied AI. I enjoy building robust, scalable backend systems and making ML workflows more efficient and reliable.

## Technical Focus

- Backend systems design and optimization
- ML platform engineering and infrastructure
- Production ML pipelines and deployment
- Distributed data processing
